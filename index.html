    <h2>CPSC 120</h2>
<h3>Lab 2</h3>
	<p>Although Lab 2 is once again simple, it shows the basics of the abilities of C++. I know C++ is much more than just a calculator, the ability it has to function as such if you want it to show the possibilities of it. I think it was a great way to learn the fundamentals
</p>
	<h3>Lab 3</h3>
	<p>  Lab 3, part 1 was my favorite because I found it very intuitive and interesting. I understand making the Sandwich madlib isnâ€™t very complicated, but it is still cool. I was able to make a program and understand every part of it and it felt more automated than anything I had made to that point. </p>
	<h3>Lab 7</h3>
	<p>   Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I have played a lot of Blackjack in the past and I had never tried to code it before. I never thought of how to think logically to make the game work in a programming environment. It made me remember teh games I used to play online and now I can see the code behind it.
